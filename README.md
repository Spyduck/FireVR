#Fire: JanusVR Exporter & IPFS Publisher

##Description

Fire is a blender addon that exports the current scene to the JanusVR FireBoxHTML-format.
It generates the XML description of the room automatically, exports the objects and provides instant publication over the IPFS network (no server needed!).  It can also export the room to a local destination (no ipfs required).

##Requirements

- [JanusVR](http://www.janusvr.com/)

Optional:
- [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/docs/install/) (only required for IPFS publication)

To use IPFS:
- IPFS must be present in the PATH.
- When not using the IPFS gateway, you need to run the IPFS daemon locally ("ipfs daemon").

This addon was tested under Ubuntu/Linux and Windows. Your feedback is welcome!
